BILL BLASINGIM.\n       REMARKS.\n           Simple MVS COBOL program\n           A simple tape to disk copy.\n\n           Input tape file came from Linux and each record \n           although a fixed length still had a line feed at the end. \n           So this program outputs everything not including the end\n           byte. The IBM utility IEBGENER can do this...\n           but I didn't know it at the time.\n\n           FYI: The input tape file is a virtual tape, but as far as \n           this program is concerned it's a real tape.\n\n       DATE-WRITTEN.
