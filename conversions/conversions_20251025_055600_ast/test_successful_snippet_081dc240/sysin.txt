Since the record structure and field definitions are not explicitly provided, I will create a hypothetical record structure based on common business data fields. Let's assume the following record structure for the purpose of generating sample data:

- Field 1: Customer ID (PIC 9(5))
- Field 2: Customer Name (PIC X(20))
- Field 3: Account Balance (PIC 9(10))
- Field 4: Account Type (PIC X(10))

Total record length: 45 characters

Here are 5 sample input records with realistic business data:

00001John Doe               00000005000Checking
00002Jane Smith              00000012000Savings
00003Alice Johnson           00000007500Checking
00004Bob Brown               00000015000Savings
00005Charlie Davis            00000020000Checking

Termination record (assuming a blank line or a specific value indicates end of input):

00000                    00000000000Unknown

This termination record is a placeholder and can be adjusted based on the actual termination condition of the COBOL program.
