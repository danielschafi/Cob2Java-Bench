Looking at this COBOL program, I can see it:

1. Uses `ACCEPT OMITTED` only once at the very end to pause before exit (waits for ENTER key)
2. Uses `ACCEPT TIME1 FROM TIME` and `ACCEPT TIME2 FROM TIME` which read from the system clock, NOT from SYSIN

The program is a performance testing utility that:
- Builds lookup tables internally
- Runs performance tests comparing custom XF4/XF5 procedures vs library calls
- Only needs user input at the very end to acknowledge completion

Since `ACCEPT FROM TIME` reads the system time (not SYSIN), and the only SYSIN input needed is a single ENTER keypress at the end, the appropriate SYSIN data is:



(A single blank line representing the ENTER key press to satisfy the `ACCEPT OMITTED` statement at program termination)
