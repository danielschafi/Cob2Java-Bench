I need to analyze this COBOL program to determine if it requires SYSIN input.

After reviewing the code, I can see that:

1. The program does NOT contain any ACCEPT statements that read from SYSIN
2. The program does NOT read from any input files
3. The program is a self-contained demonstration of doubly-linked list operations
4. All data is hardcoded within the program itself (NODE1, NODE2, NODE3, NODE4, NODE5)
5. The program only performs DISPLAY statements for output
6. It uses dynamic memory allocation (ALLOCATE/FREE) to manage linked list nodes

This program does not require any SYSIN input data. It runs completely standalone with its internal data.
